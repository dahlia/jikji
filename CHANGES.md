Jikji changelog
===============

Version 0.3.0
-------------

Released on November 14, 2023.

 -  Jikji now utilizes [`npm:` specifier][npm specifier] instead of [esm.sh]
    and [Skypack].  Therefore, it no more runs on earlier versions of Deno
    than 1.28.0.
 -  Built-in `MultiViewNegotiator`s in *multiview.ts* module became aware of
    the cookie `accept-language`, which is the most prior option for choosing
    the language:
     - `htmlRedirector`
     - `phpNegotiator`
 -  `ContentMetadata` type from *content.ts* module no more includes `null`.
 -  Added `LanguageTag.requiredPermissions` constant.
 -  Added `WriteFilesOptions` interface to *file.ts* module, which defines
    what options are available for `writeFiles()` function.
     -  Added `WriteFilesOptions#onWrite` field.
 -  The *sass.ts* module no more depends on Dart-Sass CLI (`sass`) or
    SassC (`sassc`), so no more requires `--allow-run` permission on Deno.
    Instead, it depends on [Deno Sass], a TypeScript & WebAssembly binding of
    [grass], which is written in Rust.  In order to load WebAssembly binary,
    now it requires `--allow-net=deno.land` instead.  [[#15]]
     -  The indented syntax of Sass (_\*.sass_) is no more supported.  Only
        curly-bracket syntax of SCSS (_\*.scss_) is supported.
     -  `Options#outputStyle` field from *sass.ts* module no more includes
        `"nested"` and `"compact"`.
     -  Removed `Options#precision` field from *sass.ts* module.
     -  Removed `Options#sourceMap` field from *sass.ts* module.
     -  Removed `getSassCompiler()` function from *sass.ts* module.
     -  Removed `SASS_MEDIA_TYPE` constant from *sass.ts* module.
     -  Added `REQUIRED_PERMISSIONS` constant to *sass.ts* module.
 -  Now `frontMatter` from *markdown.ts* can deal with Windows-style line
    endings (i.e., CR LF) and BOM.
